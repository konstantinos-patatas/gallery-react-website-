Project: Evergreen Flowers Website Development - Part-time project

A local flower shop faced challenges organizing and showcasing their wedding and baby shower decoration images in a single, accessible platform. To address this, I developed a responsive website that allows customers to browse the companyâ€™s content and engage by liking their favorite decorations.

<h3>The project demonstrates</h3> 
A full-stack approach combining modern frontend frameworks, backend APIs, and database management to deliver a seamless user experience.</p>

<h2 id="technologies">ðŸ’» Technologies</h2>

Frontend: Built with React and Vite to accelerate development and ensure reusable, efficient components.

UI Design: Utilized React Material UI library for structured, user-friendly cards and modals, enhancing the browsing experience.

Content Management: Decoration details are stored in JSON files, enabling easy updatesâ€”new content can be added dynamically by simply editing the JSON.

Visitor Tracking: Integrated FingerprintJS to uniquely identify visitors and prevent multiple likes from the same device, ensuring fair interaction.

Backend:

API Development: Created with Node.js and Express to handle like/unlike functionality through fast, reliable API endpoints.

Database: PostgreSQL stores user likes in a dedicated table, with queries that check and update like status based on visitor fingerprints.
