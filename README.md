Project Description:
  A local flower shop faced challenges organizing and showcasing their wedding and baby shower decoration images in a single, accessible platform. To address this, I developed a responsive website that allows customers to browse the company’s content and engage by liking their favorite decorations.
  
  Key Features:
  
  Frontend: Built with React and Vite to accelerate development and ensure reusable, efficient components.
  
  UI Design: Utilized React Material UI library for structured, user-friendly cards and modals, enhancing the browsing experience.
  
  Content Management: Decoration details are stored in JSON files, enabling easy updates—new content can be added dynamically by simply editing the JSON.
  
  Visitor Tracking: Integrated FingerprintJS to uniquely identify visitors and prevent multiple likes from the same device, ensuring fair interaction.
  
  Backend:
  
  API Development: Created with Node.js and Express to handle like/unlike functionality through fast, reliable API endpoints.
  
  Database: PostgreSQL stores user likes in a dedicated table, with queries that check and update like status based on visitor fingerprints.
  
  The project demonstrates a full-stack approach combining modern frontend frameworks, backend APIs, and database management to deliver a seamless user experience.
